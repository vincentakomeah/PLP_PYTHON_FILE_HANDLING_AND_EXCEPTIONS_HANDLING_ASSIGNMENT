# PLP_PYTHON_FILE_HANDLING_AND_EXCEPTIONS_HANDLING_ASSIGNMENT
This script reads from one text file, writes and appends to another, and lets the user view any file in a specific directory.

## 📖 README — *A Little Tale of Python and Files*

Once upon a time, in a quiet digital village called `not_useful`, a young Python script was given a special task: to explore the power of reading, writing, and discovering files.

First, it tiptoed into a tiny house called `plp_file_handler1.txt` and read everything written inside. It listened carefully, memorized the words, and printed them out for all to see.

Then, like a thoughtful scribe, it walked over to a new home — `plp_file_handler2.txt` — and carefully rewrote everything it had learned. But it didn’t stop there. Feeling inspired, the script added two heartfelt lines of its own:

* “Currently, I am learning Python Programming and loving the process.”
* “This is great. I am grateful unto Power Learn Project for this opportunity.”

With that done, the script decided to be helpful one more time. It asked the user:

> “Hey, do you want to find a specific file?”

If the user gave it a name, the script raced into the `not_useful` neighborhood in the user's `PycharmProjects`, searched every corner, and if the file existed — proudly read it aloud.
But if the file was nowhere to be found, it politely said:

> “File not found.”

And so, this little Python script became a kind and curious assistant — always ready to read, write, and help users explore the magic hidden in their files.
